While most of the work related to technical security has focused on detecting \emph{vulnerable} contracts, in this part of the chapter, we focus on finding how many of these vulnerable contracts have actually been \emph{exploited}.
We survey the~\VulnerableContracts vulnerable contracts reported by~\PapersAnalyzed recent academic projects and find that, despite the amounts at stake, only~\PercentExploitedContracts of them have been exploited since deployment.
This corresponds to at most~\ExploitedEther ETH (\textasciitilde\ExploitedEtherUSD USD\footnotemark), or only~\PercentExploitedEther of the \EtherClaimedVulnerable ETH (\EtherClaimedVulnerableUSD USD) at stake.
We explain these results by demonstrating that the funds are very concentrated in a small number of contracts which are \emph{not exploitable} in practice.
