abstract = {Ethereum is a cryptocurrency framework that uses blockchain technology to provide an open distributed computing plat-form, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). EVM programs are written in bytecode which operates on a sim-ple stack machine. Programmers do not usually write EVM code; instead, they can program in a JavaScript-like lan-guage called Solidity that compiles to bytecode. Since the main application of EVM programs is as smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets, security is of paramount importance. However, writing trustworthy smart contracts can be extremely difficult due to the intricate semantics of EVM and its openness: both programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public methods of other programs. This problem is best illustrated by the recent attack on TheDAO contract, which allowed roughly {\$}50M USD worth of Ether to be transferred into the control of an attacker. Re-covering the funds required a hard fork of the blockchain, contrary to the code is law premise of the system. In this paper, we outline a framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and the functional correctness of Solidity contracts in F , a functional programming language aimed at program verification.},

abstract = {Smart contracts (SC) are software codes which reside and run over a blockchain. The code can be written in different languages with the common purpose of implementing various kinds of transactions onto the hosting blockchain, They are ruled by the blockchain infrastructure and work in order to satisfy conditions typical of traditional contracts. The software code must satisfy constrains strongly context dependent which are quite different from traditional software code. In particular, since the bytecode is uploaded in the hosting blockchain, size, computational resources, interaction between different parts of software are all limited and even if the specific software languages implement more or less the same constructs of traditional languages there is not the same freedom as in normal software development. SC software is expected to reflect these constrains on SC software metrics which should display metric values characteristic of the domain and different from more traditional software metrics. We tested this hypothesis on the code of more than twelve thousands SC written in Solidity and uploaded on the Ethereum blockchain. We downloaded the SC from a public repository and computed the statistics of a set of software metrics related to SC and compared them to the metrics extracted from more traditional software projects. Our results show that generally Smart Contracts metrics have ranges more restricted than the corresponding metrics in traditional software systems. Some of the stylized facts, like power law in the tail of the distribution of some metrics, are only approximate but the lines of code follow a log normal distribution which reminds of the same behavior already found in traditional software systems.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs running on cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum) blockchains, whose popularity stem from the possibility to perform financial transactions, such as payments and auctions, in a distributed environment without need for any trusted third party. Given their financial nature, bugs or vulnerabilities in these programs may lead to catastrophic consequences, as witnessed by recent attacks. Unfortunately, programming smart contracts is a delicate task that requires strong expertise: Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, a dedicated language resembling JavaScript, and shipped over the blockchain in the EVM bytecode format. In order to rigorously verify the security of smart contracts, it is of paramount importance to formalize their semantics as well as the security properties of interest, in particular at the level of the bytecode being executed. In this paper, we present the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, which we formalize in the F* proof assistant, obtaining executable code that we successfully validate against the official Ethereum test suite. Furthermore, we formally define for the first time a number of central security properties for smart contracts, such as call integrity, atomicity, and independence from miner controlled parameters. This formalization relies on a combination of hyper- and safety properties. Along this work, we identified various mistakes and imprecisions in existing semantics and verification tools for Ethereum smart contracts, thereby demonstrating once more the importance of rigorous semantic foundations for the design of security verification techniques.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We introduce several new se-curity problems in which an adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable. For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60 million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the severity of other attacks for several case studies which have source code available and confirm the attacks (which target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

abstract = {The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain. Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in law, business, commerce, and governance. Smart contracts are commonly written in a high-level language such as Ethereum's Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for deployment on the blockchain. Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously executed, usually by a virtual machine. As with all programs, smart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient programming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy compilers. At the same time, smart contracts are also high-value targets, often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing low-level byte-code to detect potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts. Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations. Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion: a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the Souffl{\'{e}} language. We conduct a large-scale empirical study for a set of common smart contract security vulnerabilities, and show the effectiveness and efficiency of Vandal. Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing over 95{\%} of all 141k unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds; outperforming the current state of the art tools-Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and Rattle-under equivalent conditions .},

We explain that emerging blockchain technology is certainly a promising platform for implementing smart contracts but argue that there is a large class of applications, where blockchain is inadequate due to performance, scalability, and consistency requirements, and also due to language expressiveness and cost issues that are hard to solve. We explain that in some situations a centralised approach that does not rely on blockchain is a better alternative due to its simplicity, scalability, and performance. We suggest that in applications where decentralisation and transparency are essential, developers can advantageously combine the two approaches into hybrid solutions where some operations are enforced by enforcers deployed on--blockchains and the rest by enforcers deployed on trusted third parties.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2018. The recent growth of the blockchain technology market puts its main cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. Among them, Ethereum stands out due to its virtual machine (EVM) supporting smart contracts, i.e., distributed programs that control the flow of the digital currency Ether. Being written in a Turing complete language, Ethereum smart contracts allow for expressing a broad spectrum of financial applications. The price for this expressiveness, however, is a significant semantic complexity, which increases the risk of programming errors. Recent attacks exploiting bugs in smart contract implementations call for the design of formal verification techniques for smart contracts. This, however, requires rigorous semantic foundations, a formal characterization of the expected security properties, and dedicated abstraction techniques tailored to the specific EVM semantics. This work will overview the state-of-the-art in smart contract verification, covering formal semantics, security definitions, and verification tools. We will then focus on EtherTrust [1], a framework for the static analysis of Ethereum smart contracts which includes the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, the first formal characterization of a large class of security properties for smart contracts, and the first static analysis for EVM bytecode that comes with a proof of soundness.},

abstract = {Distributed systems play a crucial role in modern infrastructure, but are notoriously difficult to implement correctly. This difficulty arises from two main challenges: (a) correctly implementing core system components (e.g., two-phase commit), so all their internal invariants hold, and (b) correctly composing standalone system components into functioning trustworthy applications (e.g., persistent storage built on top of a two-phase commit instance). Recent work has developed several approaches for addressing (a) by means of mechanically verifying implementations of core distributed components, but no methodology exists to address (b) by composing such verified components into larger verified applications. As a result, expensive verification efforts for key system components are not easily reusable, which hinders further verification efforts. In this paper, we present Disel, the first framework for implementation and compositional verification of distributed systems and their clients, all within the mechanized, foundational context of the Coq proof assistant. In Disel, users implement distributed systems using a domain specific language shallowly embedded in Coq and providing both high-level programming constructs as well as low-level communication primitives. Components of composite systems are specified in Disel as protocols, which capture system-specific logic and disentangle system definitions from implementation details. By virtue of Disel's dependent type system, well-typed implementations always satisfy their protocols' invariants and never go wrong, allowing users to verify system implementations interactively using Disel's Hoare-style program logic, which extends state-of-the-art techniques for concurrency verification to the distributed setting. By virtue of the substitution principle and frame rule provided by Disel's logic, system components can be composed leading to modular, reusable verified distributed systems. We describe Disel, illustrate its use with a series of examples, outline its logic and metatheory, and report on our experience using it as a framework for implementing, specifying, and verifying distributed systems. 1 INTRODUCTION Real-world software systems, including distributed systems, are rarely built as standalone, monolithic pieces of code. Rather, they are composed of multiple independent modules, which are connected either by the linker or through communication channels. Such a compositional approach enables clean separation of concerns and a modular development process: in order to use one component within a larger system, one only needs to know what it does without requiring details on how it works. Unfortunately, the benefits of modular software development are not yet fully realized in the context of verified distributed systems. Recent work has produced several impressive formal proofs of correctness for implementations of core distributed system components, ranging from consensus protocols to causally consistent key-value stores (Hawblitzel et al. 2015; Lesani et al. 2016; Newcombe et al. 2015; Wilcox et al. 2015). These artifacts, while formally verified are not immediately reusable in the context of larger verified applications. For example, to compose a linearizable database with a causally consistent cache (Ahamad et al. 1995), one would need a framework general enough to express both specifications and reason about their interaction. Furthermore, existing verified systems entangle implementation details with abstract protocol definitions, preventing independent evolution and requiring extensive refactoring when changes are made (Woos et al. 2016). Finally, like all software, real-world distributed systems exist in an open world, and should be usable in multiple contexts by various clients, each of which may make different assumptions.},

abstract = {Satoshi Nakamoto's development of Bitcoin in 2009 has often been hailed as a radical development in money and currency, being the first example of a digital asset which simultaneously has no backing or "intrinsic value" and no centralized issuer or controller. However, another, arguably more important, part of the Bitcoin experiment is the underlying blockchain technology as a tool of distributed consensus, and attention is rapidly starting to shift to this other aspect of Bitcoin. Commonly cited alternative applications of blockchain technology include using on-blockchain digital assets to represent custom currencies and financial instruments ("colored coins"), the ownership of an underlying physical device ("smart property"), non-fungible assets such as domain names ("Namecoin"), as well as more complex applications involving having digital assets being directly controlled by a piece of code implementing arbitrary rules ("smart contracts") or even blockchain-based "decentralized autonomous organizations" (DAOs). What Ethereum intends to provide is a blockchain with a built-in fully fledged Turing-complete programming language that can be used to create "contracts" that can be used to encode arbitrary state transition functions, allowing users to create any of the systems described above, as well as many others that we have not yet imagined, simply by writing up the logic in a few lines of code.},

Previous protocols for this task required a security deposit that is {\$}O(N{\^{}}2){\$} times larger than the bet amount, where {\$}N{\$} is the number of players. Our protocols are based on a tournament bracket construction, and require only {\$}O(\backslashlog N){\$} rounds. Our lottery protocols thus represent a significant improvement, both because they allow players with little money to participate, and because of the time value of money. The Ethereum-based implementation of our lottery is highly efficient. The Bitcoin implementation requires an {\$}O(2{\^{}}N){\$} off-chain setup phase, which demonstrates that the expressive power of the scripting language can have important implications. We also describe a minimal modification to the Bitcoin protocol that would eliminate the exponential blowup.},

abstract = {—Bugs severely hurt blockchain system dependability. A thorough understanding of blockchain bug characteristics is required to design effective tools for preventing, detecting and mitigating bugs. We perform an empirical study on bug charac-teristics in eight representative open source blockchain systems. First, we manually examine 1,108 bug reports to understand the nature of the reported bugs. Second, we leverage card sorting to label the bug reports, and obtain ten bug categories in blockchain systems. We further investigate the frequency distribution of bug categories across projects and programming languages. Finally, we study the relationship between bug categories and bug fixing time. The findings include: (1) semantic bugs are the dominant runtime bug category; (2) frequency distributions of bug types show similar trends across different projects and programming languages; (3) security bugs take the longest median time to be fixed; (4) 35.71{\%} performance bugs are fixed in more than one year; performance bugs take the longest average time to be fixed.},

@article{Dickerson2017,
abstract = {Modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, permit complex financial transactions through scripts called smart contracts. These smart contracts are executed many, many times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart contracts are serially executed by miners before appending them to the blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially re-executed by validators to verify that the smart contracts were executed correctly by miners. Serial execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit today's concurrent multicore and cluster architectures. Nevertheless, serial execution appears to be required: contracts share state, and contract programming languages have a serial semantics. This paper presents a novel way to permit miners and validators to execute smart contracts in parallel, based on techniques adapted from software transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting contracts to proceed concurrently, and "discovering" a serializable concurrent schedule for a block's transactions, This schedule is captured and encoded as a deterministic fork-join program used by validators to re-execute the miner's parallel schedule deterministically but concurrently. Smart contract benchmarks run on a JVM with ScalaSTM show that a speedup of of 1.33x can be obtained for miners and 1.69x for validators with just three concurrent threads.},

Advocates and engineers have recently proposed using defensive deception as a means to leverage the information asymmetry typically enjoyed by attackers as a tool for defenders. The term deception, however, has been employed broadly and with a variety of meanings. In this paper, we survey 24 articles from 2007-2017 that use game theory to model defensive deception for cybersecurity and privacy. Then we propose a taxonomy that defines six types of deception: perturbation, moving target defense, obfuscation, mixing, honey-x, and attacker engagement. These types are delineated by their incentive structures, agents, actions, and duration: precisely concepts captured by game theory. Our aims are to rigorously define types of defensive deception, to capture a snapshot of the state of the literature, to provide a menu of models which can be used for applied research, and to identify promising areas for future work. Our taxonomy provides a systematic foundation for understanding different types of defensive deception commonly encountered in cybersecurity and privacy.},

Over the last few years many platforms for smart contracts have been proposed, and some of them have been actually implemented and used. We study how the notion of smart contract is interpreted in some of these platforms. Focussing on the two most widespread ones, Bitcoin and Ethereum, we quantify the usage of smart contracts in relation to their application domain.

In Ethereum, gas (in Ether, a cryptographic currency like Bitcoin) is the execution fee compensating the computing resources of miners for running smart contracts. However, we find that under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. In this work, we conduct the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we identify 7 gas-costly patterns and group them to 2 categories. Then, we propose and develop GASPER, a new tool for automatically locating gas-costly patterns by analyzing smart contracts' bytecodes. The preliminary results on discovering 3 representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5{\%}, 90.1{\%} and 80{\%} contracts suffer from these 3 patterns, respectively.},

In light of this, several regulatory bodies have called for a need to audit smart contracts for security and correctness guarantees. Unfortunately, auditing smart contracts that do not have readily available source code can be challenging , and there are currently few tools available that aid in this process. Such contracts remain opaque to auditors. To address this, we present Erays, a reverse engineering tool for smart contracts. Erays takes in smart contract from the Ethereum blockchain, and produces high-level pseudocode suitable for manual analysis. We show how Erays can be used to provide insight into several contract properties, such as code complexity and code reuse in the ecosystem. We then leverage Erays to link contracts with no previously available source code to public source code, thus reducing the overall opacity in the ecosystem. Finally, we demonstrate how Erays can be used for reverse-engineering in four case studies: high-value multi-signature wallets, arbitrage bots, exchange accounts, and finally, a popular smart-contract game, Cryptokitties. We conclude with a discussion regarding the value of reverse engineering in the smart contract ecosystem, and how Erays can be leveraged to address the challenges that lie ahead.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 ACM. Efficient concurrent programs and data structures rarely employ coarse-grained synchronization mechanisms (i.e., locks); instead, they implement custom synchronization patterns via fine-grained primitives, such as compare-and-swap. Due to sophisticated interference scenarios between threads, reasoning about such programs is challenging and error-prone, and can benefit from mechanization. In this paper, we present the first completely formalized framework for mechanized verification of full functional correctness of fine-grained concurrent programs. Our tool is based on the recently proposed program logic FCSL. It is implemented as an embedded domain-specific language in the dependently-typed language of the Coq proof assistant, and is powerful enough to reason about programming features such as higher-order functions and local thread spawning. By incorporating a uniform concurrency model, based on state-transition systems and partial commutative monoids, FCSL makes it possible to build proofs about concurrent libraries in a thread-local, compositional way, thus facilitating scalability and reuse: libraries are verified just once, and their specifi-cations are used ubiquitously in client-side reasoning. We illustrate the proof layout in FCSL by example, and report on our experience of using FCSL to verify a number of concurrent programs.},

abstract = {Motivation. Public ledger is a decentralized book keeping technology and is believed to have the potential to revolutionize many areas. Besides handling crypto-currency, public ledger can be used to tokenize arbitrary assets, and then support trading of these asset tokens in a decentralized manner. With public ledger based token trading system, users do not necessarily convert their assets to currencies, but can exchange assets directly. It also avoids unnecessary transportation as the asset only needs to be physically transferred to its last owner. Furthermore, utilization of the public ledger does not require that users have to trust each other in order to trade tokens safely. However, using decentralized public ledger for trading asset tokens raises serious privacy concerns. Because token ownership information is stored on the public ledger and disclosed to the public, anyone can uncover users trading activities and history. For a token based asset trading platform, all tokens are unique and transactions are usually two-ways or multi-ways. In response to these challenges, we propose ZeroTrade, a privacy respecting heterogeneous assets trading system that leverages various cryptography tools to conceal the exchange trace of asset tokens and takes advantage of public ledger for guaranteeing fairness of asset token exchange. Solution. ZeroTrade involves trusted hubs that are responsible for converting assets to tokens and back, where trusted means that hubs will generate/accept valid tokens, and uses the public ledger to record all token exchange information. When two or more users want to exchange tokens with each other, each user picks an agent for the exchange. Asset tokens are first poured into a pool and users leverage agents to obliviously retrieve tokens from the pool in order to finish the exchange. The oblivious retrieving process cut off the connection between the original user and the agent. Therefore, one cannot determine the relationship between the original users who want to exchange tokens by observing information recorded on the public ledger. To implement the design, ZeroTrade leverages different cryptography tools including zero-knowledge proof and various encryption techniques. Considering various demands in token trade, ZeroTrade also supports operations like partial token trade and revocation. A preliminary evaluation of the performance shows that ZeroTrade only adds limited burden on top of the public ledger. More detailed information can be found in the full version of the paper. Conclusion. ZeroTrade provides a privacy friendly platform for asset trading based on public ledger. For the next step, we plan to implement a fully functional prototype and considering more complex token trading scenarios. {\textcopyright} International Financial Cryptography Association 2017.},

abstract = {Permissionless blockchains allow the execution of arbitrary programs (called smart contracts), enabling mutually untrusted entities to interact without relying on trusted third parties. Despite their potential, repeated security concerns have shaken the trust in handling billions of USD by smart contracts. To address this problem, we present Securify, a security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated, and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with respect to a given property. Securify's analysis consists of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the contract's dependency graph to extract precise semantic information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for proving if a property holds or not. To enable extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated domain-specific language. Securify is publicly released, has {\~{}}22K users, and is regularly used to conduct security audits. We present an extensive evaluation of Securify over real-world Ethereum smart contracts and demonstrate that it can effectively prove the correctness of smart contracts and discover critical violations.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are computer programs that can be correctly executed by a network of mutually distrusting nodes, without the need of an external trusted authority. Since smart contracts handle and transfer assets of considerable value, besides their correct execution it is also crucial that their implementation is secure against attacks which aim at stealing or tampering the assets. We study this problem in Ethereum, the most well-known and used framework for smart contracts so far. We analyse the security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts, providing a taxonomy of common programming pitfalls which may lead to vulnerabilities. We show a series of attacks which exploit these vulnerabilities, allowing an adversary to steal money or cause other damage.},

abstract = {Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies are gaining unprecedented popularity and understanding. Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining a significant popularity in the blockchain community, mainly due to the fact that it is designed in a way that enables developers to write smart contract and decentralized applications (Dapps). This new paradigm of applications opens the door to many possibilities and opportunities. However, the security of Ethereum smart contracts has not received much attention; several Ethereum smart contracts malfunctioning have recently been reported. Unlike many previous works that have applied static and dynamic analyses to find bugs in smart contracts, we do not attempt to define and extract any features; instead we focus on reducing the expert's labor costs. We first present a new in-depth analysis of potential attacks methodology and then translate the bytecode of solidity into RGB color code. After that, we transform them to a fixed-sized encoded image. Finally, the encoded image is fed to convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic feature extraction and learning, detecting compiler bugs of Ethereum smart contract.},

@article{Bravenboer2009,
abstract = {Exception analysis and points-to analysis are typically done in complete separation. Past algorithms for precise exception anal- ysis (e.g., pairing throw clauses with catch statements) use pre- computed points-to information. Past points-to analyses either un- soundly ignore exceptions, or conservatively compute a crude ap- proximation of exception throwing (e.g., considering an exception throw as an assignment to a global variable, accessible from any catch clause). We show that this separation results in significant slowdowns or vast imprecision. The two kinds of analyses are inter- dependent: neither can be performed accurately without the other. The interdependency leads us to propose a joint handling for per- formance and precision. We show that our exception analysis is expressible highly elegantly in a declarative form, and can apply to points-to analyses of varying precision. In fact, our specification of exception analysis is “fully precise”, as it models closely the Java exception handling semantics. The necessary approximation is pro- vided only through whichever abstractions are used for contexts and objects in the base points-to analysis. Our combined approach achieves similar precision relative to exceptions (exception-catch links) as the best past precise exception analysis, with a runtime of seconds instead of tens of minutes. At the same time, our analysis achieves much higher precision of points-to information (an aver- age of half as many values for each reachable variable for most of the DaCapo benchmarks) than points-to analyses that treat excep- tions conservatively, all at a fraction of the execution time.},

abstract = {Blockchains primarily enable credible accounting of digital events, e.g., money transfers in cryptocurrencies. However, beyond this original purpose, blockchains also irrevocably record arbitrary data, ranging from short messages to pictures. This does not come without risk for users as each participant has to locally replicate the complete blockchain, particularly including potentially harmful content. We provide the first systematic analysis of the benefits and threats of arbitrary blockchain content. Our analysis shows that certain content, e.g., illegal pornography, can render the mere possession of a blockchain illegal. Based on these insights, we conduct a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of unintended content on Bitcoin's blockchain. Although most data originates from benign extensions to Bitcoin's protocol, our analysis reveals more than 1600 files on the blockchain, over 99{\%} of which are texts or images. Among these files there is clearly objectionable content such as links to child pornography, which is distributed to all Bitcoin participants. With our analysis, we thus highlight the importance for future blockchain designs to address the possibility of unintended data insertion and protect blockchain users accordingly.},

abstract = {Maternal obesity due to long-term high-fat diet (HFD) consumption leads to faster growth in offspring during suckling, and increased adiposity at 20 days of age. Decreased expression of the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY) and increased anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA expression were observed in the fed state. However, hunger is the major drive to eat and hypothalamic appetite regulators change in response to meals. Therefore, it is important to compare both satiated and fasting states. Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) were fed a cafeteria-style HFD (15.33 kJ/g) or chow for 5 weeks before mating, with the same diet continuing throughout gestation and lactation. At postnatal day 20, male pups were killed either after overnight fasting or in the fed state. Pups from obese dams were hyperphagic during both pre- and postweaning periods. Pups from obese dams had higher hypothalamic mRNA expression of POMC and NPY Y1 receptor, but lower hypothalamic melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and its downstream target single-minded gene 1 (Sim1), in the fed state. Overnight fasting reduced circulating glucose, insulin, and leptin and increased hypothalamic NPY Y1 receptor mRNA in pups from both lean and obese dams. Hypothalamic NPY and agouti-related protein (AgRP) were only increased by fasting in pups from obese dams; reductions in MC4R and Sim1 were only seen in pups from lean dams. At weaning, the suppressed orexigenic signals in offspring from obese dams were normalized after overnight fasting, although anorexigenic signaling appeared impaired in these animals. This may contribute to their hyperphagia and faster growth.},
