  abstract  = {In Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies, fair reward distribution within mining pools has become a popular area of research. Aside from a theoretical grounding, mining pool reward scheme research has commonly involved discrete event simulations of deterministic miner behaviour under different reward schemes. However, until now researchers have been left with the tedious task of developing their own mining pool simulation software, a rather time-consuming and potentially extensive undertaking, as miner behaviour becomes more complex. We present PoolSim, an open-source and very extensible discrete event simulation framework for modelling different behaviours of miners under any reward distribution scheme. By utilising this framework for different hypothetical mining scenarios, we showcase that mining pool reward scheme analysis indeed remains an exciting area for future research. Further, we believe that PoolSim will vastly increase productivity of researchers focusing on mining pools.},

  abstract  = {We coin the term Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLFs) to refer to protocols which establish distributed ledger-based markets for loanable funds. PLFs are emerging as one of the main applications within Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and use smart contract code to facilitate the intermediation of loanable funds. In doing so, these protocols allow agents to borrow and save programmatically. Within these protocols, interest rate mechanisms seek to equilibrate the supply and demand for funds. In this paper, we review the methodologies used to set interest rates on three prominent DeFi PLFs, namely Compound, Aave and dYdX. We provide an empirical examination of how these interest rate rules have behaved since their inception in response to differing degrees of liquidity. We then investigate the market efficiency and inter-connectedness between multiple protocols, examining first whether Uncovered Interest Parity holds within a particular protocol and second whether the interest rates for a particular token market show dependence across protocols, developing a Vector Error Correction Model for the dynamics.},

  abstract   = {As an integral part of the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem, decentralized exchanges (DEXs) with automated market maker (AMM) protocols have gained massive traction with the recently revived interest in blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) in general. Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, automated market makers (AMMs) employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. To facilitate the improvement and development of AMM-based decentralized exchanges (DEXs), we create the first systematization of knowledge in this area. We first establish a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system’s state-space representation. We then employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols’ mechanics, illustrating their conservation functions, as well as slippage and divergence loss functions. We further discuss security and privacy concerns, how they are enabled by AMM-based DEXs’ inherent properties, and explore mitigating solutions. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive literature review on related work covering both DeFi and conventional market microstructure.},

               correctly executed by a network of mutually distrusting
               nodes, without the need of an external trusted authority.
               Since smart contracts handle and transfer assets of
               considerable value, besides their correct execution it is
               also crucial that their implementation is secure against
               attacks which aim at stealing or tampering the assets. We
               study this problem in Ethereum, the most well-known and
               used framework for smart contracts so far. We analyse the
               security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts,
               providing a taxonomy of common programming pitfalls which
               may lead to vulnerabilities. We show a series of attacks
               which exploit these vulnerabilities, allowing an adversary
               to steal money or cause other damage.},

  abstract      = {The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the emergence of smart contracts: autonomous programs that live and run on the blockchain. Smart contracts have seen a rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in law, business, commerce, and governance. Smart contracts are commonly written in a high-level language such as Ethereum's Solidity, and translated to compact low-level bytecode for deployment on the blockchain. Once deployed, the bytecode is autonomously executed, usually by a virtual machine. As with all programs, smart contracts can be highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient programming methodologies, languages, and toolchains, including buggy compilers. At the same time, smart contracts are also high-value targets, often commanding large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing low-level byte-code to detect potential security vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present Vandal: a security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts. Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to semantic logic relations. Users of the framework can express security analyses in a declarative fashion: a security analysis is expressed in a logic specification written in the Souffl{\'{e}} language. We conduct a large-scale empirical study for a set of common smart contract security vulnerabilities, and show the effectiveness and efficiency of Vandal. Vandal is both fast and robust, successfully analysing over 95{\%} of all 141k unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds; outperforming the current state of the art tools-Oyente, EthIR, Mythril, and Rattle-under equivalent conditions .},

  abstract      = {Smart contracts are full-fledged programs that run on blockchains (e.g., Ethereum, one of the most popular blockchains). In Ethereum, gas (in Ether, a cryptographic currency like Bitcoin) is the execution fee compensating the computing resources of miners for running smart contracts. However, we find that under-optimized smart contracts cost more gas than necessary, and therefore the creators or users will be overcharged. In this work, we conduct the first investigation on Solidity, the recommended compiler, and reveal that it fails to optimize gas-costly programming patterns. In particular, we identify 7 gas-costly patterns and group them to 2 categories. Then, we propose and develop GASPER, a new tool for automatically locating gas-costly patterns by analyzing smart contracts' bytecodes. The preliminary results on discovering 3 representative patterns from 4,240 real smart contracts show that 93.5{\%}, 90.1{\%} and 80{\%} contracts suffer from these 3 patterns, respectively.},

               punishes the operations that are executed much more frequently than before and lead to high gas costs. To make our solution flexible and secure and avoid frequent update of Eth

We present ZEUS-a framework to verify the correctness and validate the fairness of smart contracts. We consider correctness as adherence to safe programming practices, while fairness is adherence to agreed upon higher-level business logic. ZEUS leverages both abstract interpretation and symbolic model checking, along with the power of constrained horn clauses to quickly verify contracts for safety. We have built a prototype of ZEUS for Ethereum and Fabric blockchain platforms, and evaluated it with over 22.4K smart contracts. Our evaluation indicates that about 94.6{\%} of contracts (containing cryptocurrency worth more than {\$}0.5 billion) are vulnerable. ZEUS is sound with zero false negatives and has a low false positive rate, with an order of magnitude improvement in analysis time as compared to prior art.},

  abstract      = {Smart contracts are programs running on cryptocurrency (e.g., Ethereum) blockchains, whose popularity stem from the possibility to perform financial transactions, such as payments and auctions, in a distributed environment without need for any trusted third party. Given their financial nature, bugs or vulnerabilities in these programs may lead to catastrophic consequences, as witnessed by recent attacks. Unfortunately, programming smart contracts is a delicate task that requires strong expertise: Ethereum smart contracts are written in Solidity, a dedicated language resembling JavaScript, and shipped over the blockchain in the EVM bytecode format. In order to rigorously verify the security of smart contracts, it is of paramount importance to formalize their semantics as well as the security properties of interest, in particular at the level of the bytecode being executed. In this paper, we present the first complete small-step semantics of EVM bytecode, which we formalize in the F* proof assistant, obtaining executable code that we successfully validate against the official Ethereum test suite. Furthermore, we formally define for the first time a number of central security properties for smart contracts, such as call integrity, atomicity, and independence from miner controlled parameters. This formalization relies on a combination of hyper- and safety properties. Along this work, we identified various mistakes and imprecisions in existing semantics and verification tools for Ethereum smart contracts, thereby demonstrating once more the importance of rigorous semantic foundations for the design of security verification techniques.},

@inproceedings{luu2016a,
  abstract     = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized
                  data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular
                  cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the
                  fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing
                  transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical
                  shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged
                  programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's
                  smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting
                  tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars
                  worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the
                  security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an
                  open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We
                  introduce several new se-curity problems in which an
                  adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain
                  profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding
                  of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As
                  a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational
                  semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable.
                  For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum
                  system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to
                  find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing
                  Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as
                  vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60
                  million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the

  abstract  = {The trustless nature of permissionless blockchains renders overcollateralization a key safety component relied upon by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Nonetheless, factors such as price volatility may undermine this mechanism. In order to protect protocols from suffering losses, undercollateralized positions can be liquidated. In this paper, we present the first in-depth empirical analysis of liquidations on protocols for loanable funds (PLFs). We examine Compound, one of the most widely used PLFs, for a period starting from its conception to September 2020. We analyze participants' behavior and risk-appetite in particular, to elucidate recent developments in the dynamics of the protocol. Furthermore, we assess how this has changed with a modification in Compound's incentive structure and show that variations of only 3{\%} in an asset's dollar price can result in over 10 m USD becoming liquidable. To further understand the implications of this, we investigate the efficiency of liquidators. We find that liquidators' efficiency has improved significantly over time, with currently over 70{\%} of liquidable positions being immediately liquidated. Lastly, we provide a discussion on how a false sense of security fostered by a misconception of the stability of non-custodial stablecoins, increases the overall liquidation risk faced by Compound participants.},

@article{Tsankov2018,
  abstract        = {Permissionless blockchains allow the execution of arbitrary programs (called smart contracts), enabling mutually untrusted entities to interact without relying on trusted third parties. Despite their potential, repeated security concerns have shaken the trust in handling billions of USD by smart contracts. To address this problem, we present Securify, a security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated, and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with respect to a given property. Securify's analysis consists of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the contract's dependency graph to extract precise semantic information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for proving if a property holds or not. To enable extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated domain-specific language. Securify is publicly released, has {\~{}}22K users, and is regularly used to conduct security audits. We present an extensive evaluation of Securify over real-world Ethereum smart contracts and demonstrate that it can effectively prove the correctness of smart contracts and discover critical violations.},

  abstract  = {On an Ethereum node, txpool (a.k.a. mempool) is a buffer storing unconfirmed transactions and controls what downstream services can see, such as mining and transaction propagation. This work presents the first security study on Ethereum txpool designs.We discover flawed transaction handling in all known Ethereum clients (e.g., Geth), and by exploiting it, design a series of low-cost denial-of-service attacks named DETER. A DETER attacker can disable a remote Ethereum node's txpool and deny the critical downstream services in mining, transaction propagation, Gas station, etc. By design, DETER attacks incur zero or low Ether cost. The attack can be amplified to cause global disruption to an Ethereum network by targeting centralized network services there (e.g., mining pools and transaction relay services). By evaluating local nodes, we verify the effectiveness and low cost of DETER attacks on all known Ethereum clients and in major testnets. We design non-trivial measurement methods against blackbox mainnet nodes and conduct light probes to confirm that popular mainnet services are exploitable under DETER attacks.We propose mitigation schemes that reduce a DETER attack's success rate down to zero while preserving the miners' revenue.},
