  abstract	= {The Ethereum platform is a public, distributed,
		  blockchain-based database that is maintained by independent
		  parties. A user interacts with Ethereum by writing programs
		  and having miners execute them for a fee charged on-the-fly
		  based on the complexity of the execution. The exact fee,
		  measured in gas consumption, in general depends on the
		  unknown Ethereum state, and predicting even its worst case
		  is in principle undecidable. Uncertainty in gas consumption
		  may result in inefficiency, loss of money, and, in extreme
		  cases, in funds being locked for an indeterminate duration.
		  This feasibility study presents two methods for determining
		  the exact worst-case gas consumption of a bounded Ethereum
		  execution using methods influenced by symbolic model
		  checking. We give several concrete cases where gas
		  consumption estimation is needed, and provide two
		  approaches for determining gas consumption, one based on
		  symbolically enumerating execution paths, and the other
		  based on computing paths modularly based on the program
		  structure.},

  abstract	= {The classical approach to automatic cost analysis consists
		  of two phases. Given a program and some measure of cost, we
		  first produce recurrence relations (RRs) which capture the
		  cost of our program in terms of the size of its input data.
		  Second, we convert such RRs into closed form (i.e., without
		  recurrences). Whereas the first phase has received
		  considerable attention, with a number of cost analyses
		  available for a variety of programming languages, the
		  second phase has received comparatively little attention.
		  In this paper we first study the features of RRs generated
		  by automatic cost analysis and discuss why existing
		  computer algebra systems are not appropriate for
		  automatically obtaining closed form solutions nor upper
		  bounds of them. Then we present, to our knowledge, the
		  first practical framework for the fully automatic
		  generation of reasonably accurate upper bounds of RRs
		  originating from cost analysis of a wide range of programs.
		  It is based on the inference of ranking functions and loop
		  invariants and on partial evaluation.},

  abstract  = {Ethereum is a cryptocurrency framework that uses
               blockchain technology to provide an open distributed
               computing plat-form, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine
               (EVM). EVM programs are written in bytecode which operates
               on a sim-ple stack machine. Programmers do not usually
               write EVM code; instead, they can program in a
               JavaScript-like lan-guage called Solidity that compiles to
               bytecode. Since the main application of EVM programs is as
               smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets,
               security is of paramount importance. However, writing
               trustworthy smart contracts can be extremely difficult due
               to the intricate semantics of EVM and its openness: both
               programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public
               methods of other programs. This problem is best illustrated
               by the recent attack on TheDAO contract, which allowed
               roughly {\$}50M USD worth of Ether to be transferred into
               the control of an attacker. Re-covering the funds required
               a hard fork of the blockchain, contrary to the code is law
               premise of the system. In this paper, we outline a
               framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and
               the functional correctness of Solidity contracts in F , a
               functional programming language aimed at program
               verification.},

  abstract	= {Ethereum is a cryptocurrency framework that uses
		  blockchain technology to provide an open distributed
		  computing plat-form, called the Ethereum Virtual Machine
		  (EVM). EVM programs are written in bytecode which operates
		  on a sim-ple stack machine. Programmers do not usually
		  write EVM code; instead, they can program in a
		  JavaScript-like lan-guage called Solidity that compiles to
		  bytecode. Since the main application of EVM programs is as
		  smart contracts that manage and transfer digital assets,
		  security is of paramount importance. However, writing
		  trustworthy smart contracts can be extremely difficult due
		  to the intricate semantics of EVM and its openness: both
		  programs and pseudonymous users can call into the public
		  methods of other programs. This problem is best illustrated
		  by the recent attack on TheDAO contract, which allowed
		  roughly {\$}50M USD worth of Ether to be transferred into
		  the control of an attacker. Re-covering the funds required
		  a hard fork of the blockchain, contrary to the code is law
		  premise of the system. In this paper, we outline a
		  framework to analyze and verify both the runtime safety and
		  the functional correctness of Solidity contracts in F , a
		  functional programming language aimed at program
		  verification.},

  abstract = {Exception analysis and points-to analysis are typically
              done in complete separation. Past algorithms for precise
              exception anal- ysis (e.g., pairing throw clauses with
              catch statements) use pre- computed points-to information.
              Past points-to analyses either un- soundly ignore
              exceptions, or conservatively compute a crude ap-
              proximation of exception throwing (e.g., considering an
              exception throw as an assignment to a global variable,
              accessible from any catch clause). We show that this
              separation results in significant slowdowns or vast
              imprecision. The two kinds of analyses are inter-
              dependent: neither can be performed accurately without the
              other. The interdependency leads us to propose a joint
              handling for per- formance and precision. We show that our
              exception analysis is expressible highly elegantly in a
              declarative form, and can apply to points-to analyses of
              varying precision. In fact, our specification of exception
              analysis is “fully precise”, as it models closely the
              Java exception handling semantics. The necessary
              approximation is pro- vided only through whichever
              abstractions are used for contexts and objects in the base

              precision relative to exceptions (exception-catch links) as
              the best past precise exception analysis, with a runtime of
              seconds instead of tens of minutes. At the same time, our
              analysis achieves much higher precision of points-to
              information (an aver- age of half as many values for each
              reachable variable for most of the DaCapo benchmarks) than

@techreport{brent2018,
  abstract      = {The rise of modern blockchains has facilitated the
                   emergence of smart contracts: autonomous programs that live
                   and run on the blockchain. Smart contracts have seen a
                   rapid climb to prominence, with applications predicted in
                   law, business, commerce, and governance. Smart contracts
                   are commonly written in a high-level language such as
                   Ethereum's Solidity, and translated to compact low-level
                   bytecode for deployment on the blockchain. Once deployed,
                   the bytecode is autonomously executed, usually by a virtual
                   machine. As with all programs, smart contracts can be
                   highly vulnerable to malicious attacks due to deficient
                   programming methodologies, languages, and toolchains,
                   including buggy compilers. At the same time, smart
                   contracts are also high-value targets, often commanding
                   large amounts of cryptocurrency. Hence, developers and
                   auditors need security frameworks capable of analysing
                   low-level byte-code to detect potential security
                   vulnerabilities. In this paper, we present Vandal: a
                   security analysis framework for Ethereum smart contracts.
                   Vandal consists of an analysis pipeline that converts
                   low-level Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode to
                   semantic logic relations. Users of the framework can
                   express security analyses in a declarative fashion: a
                   security analysis is expressed in a logic specification
                   written in the Souffl{\'{e}} language. We conduct a
                   large-scale empirical study for a set of common smart
                   contract security vulnerabilities, and show the
                   effectiveness and efficiency of Vandal. Vandal is both fast
                   and robust, successfully analysing over 95{\%} of all 141k
                   unique contracts with an average runtime of 4.15 seconds;
                   outperforming the current state of the art tools-Oyente,

  abstract  = {The gas mechanism in Ethereum charges the execution of
               every operation to ensure that smart contracts running in
               EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) will be eventually
               terminated. Failing to properly set the gas costs of EVM
               operations allows attackers to launch DoS attacks on
               Ethereum. Although Ethereum recently adjusted the gas costs
               of EVM operations to defend against known DoS attacks, it
               remains unknown whether the new setting is proper and how
               to configure it to defend against unknown DoS attacks. In
               this paper, we make the first step to address this
               challenging issue by first proposing an emulation-based
               framework to automatically measure the resource
               consumptions of EVM operations. The results reveal that
               Ethereum's new setting is still not proper. Moreover, we
               obtain an insight that there may always exist exploitable
               under-priced operations if the cost is fixed. Hence, we
               propose a novel gas cost mechanism, which dynamically
               adjusts the costs of EVM operations according to the number
               of executions, to thwart DoS attacks. This method punishes
               the operations that are executed much more frequently than
               before and lead to high gas costs. To make our solution
               flexible and secure and avoid frequent update of Ethereum
               client, we design a special smart contract that
               collaborates with the updated EVM for dynamic parameter
               adjustment. Experimental results demonstrate that our
               method can effectively thwart both known and unknown DoS

                   topics regarding smart contracts (such as terminology,

                   smart contract as an agreement whose execution is both
                   automatable and enforceable. We explore a simple semantic
                   framework for smart contracts, covering both operational
                   and non-operational aspects. We describe templates and
                   agreements for legally-enforceable smart contracts, based
                   on legal documents. Building upon the Ricardian Contract

  abstract        = {A smart contract is hard to patch for bugs once it is
                     deployed, irrespective of the money it holds. A recent bug
                     caused losses worth around {\$}50 million of
                     cryptocurrency. We present ZEUS-a framework to verify the
                     correctness and validate the fairness of smart contracts.
                     We consider correctness as adherence to safe programming
                     practices, while fairness is adherence to agreed upon
                     higher-level business logic. ZEUS leverages both abstract
                     interpretation and symbolic model checking, along with the
                     power of constrained horn clauses to quickly verify
                     contracts for safety. We have built a prototype of ZEUS for
                     Ethereum and Fabric blockchain platforms, and evaluated it
                     with over 22.4K smart contracts. Our evaluation indicates
                     that about 94.6{\%} of contracts (containing cryptocurrency
                     worth more than {\$}0.5 billion) are vulnerable. ZEUS is
                     sound with zero false negatives and has a low false
                     positive rate, with an order of magnitude improvement in
                     analysis time as compared to prior art.},

		  it will take to execute every single operation that takes
		  part in the Ethereum blockchain platform. Each instruction
		  executed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) has an
		  associated gas consumption specified by Ethereum. If a
		  transaction exceeds the amount of gas allotted by the user
		  (known as gas limit), an out-of-gas exception is raised.
		  There is a wide family of contract vulnerabilities due to
		  out-of-gas behaviours. We report on the design and
		  implementation of GASTAP, a Gas-Aware Smart contracT
		  Analysis Platform, which takes as input a smart contract
		  (either in EVM, disassembled EVM, or in Solidity source
		  code) and automatically infers sound gas upper bounds for
		  all its public functions. Our bounds ensure that if the gas
		  limit paid by the user is higher than our inferred gas
		  bounds, the contract is free of out-of-gas
		  vulnerabilities.},

		  of$\backslash$nour framework by applying it to the
		  synthesis of $\backslash$textit{\{}query
		  structures{\}}$\backslash$n-- abstract data types with

		  includes a library for writing specifications of query
		  structures$\backslash$nin SQL-inspired notation, expressing
		  operations over relations (tables)$\backslash$nin terms of
		  mathematical sets. This library includes a set of
		  tactics$\backslash$nfor automating the refinement of these
		  specifications into
		  efficient,$\backslash$ncorrect-by-construction OCaml code.
		  Using these tactics, a programmer$\backslash$ncan generate
		  such an implementation completely automatically by
		  only$\backslash$nspecifying the equivalent of SQL indexes,
		  data structures capturing$\backslash$nuseful views of the

  abstract      = {Modern cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, permit
                   complex financial transactions through scripts called smart
                   contracts. These smart contracts are executed many, many
                   times, always without real concurrency. First, all smart
                   contracts are serially executed by miners before appending
                   them to the blockchain. Later, those contracts are serially
                   re-executed by validators to verify that the smart
                   contracts were executed correctly by miners. Serial
                   execution limits system throughput and fails to exploit
                   today's concurrent multicore and cluster architectures.
                   Nevertheless, serial execution appears to be required:
                   contracts share state, and contract programming languages
                   have a serial semantics. This paper presents a novel way to
                   permit miners and validators to execute smart contracts in
                   parallel, based on techniques adapted from software
                   transactional memory. Miners execute smart contracts
                   speculatively in parallel, allowing non-conflicting

  abstract	= {Ethereum is a distributed blockchain platform, serving as
		  an ecosystem for smart contracts: full-fledged
		  inter-communicating programs that capture the transaction
		  logic of an account. Unlike programs in mainstream
		  languages, the execution of an Ethereum smart contract is
		  restricted by a gas limit: execution proceeds as long as
		  gas is available. Thus, gas is a valuable resource that can
		  be manipulated by an attacker to provoke unwanted behavior
		  in a victim's smart contract (e.g., wasting or blocking
		  funds of said victim). Gas-focused vulnerabilities exploit
		  undesired behavior when a contract (directly or through
		  other interacting contracts) runs out of gas. Such
		  vulnerabilities are among the hardest for programmers to
		  protect against, as out-of-gas behavior may be uncommon in
		  non-attack scenarios and reasoning about it is far from
		  trivial. In this paper, we classify and identify
		  gas-focused vulnerabilities, and present MadMax: a static
		  program analysis technique to automatically detect
		  gas-focused vulnerabilities with very high confidence. Our
		  approach combines a control-flow-analysis-based decompiler
		  and declarative program-structure queries. The combined
		  analysis captures high-level domain-specific concepts (such
		  as “dynamic data structure storage” and “safely
		  resumable loops”) and achieves high precision and
		  scalability. MadMax analyzes the entirety of smart
		  contracts in the current Ethereum blockchain in just 10
		  hours (with decompilation timeouts in 8{\%} of the cases)
		  and flags contracts with a current (though highly volatile)
		  monetary value of over {\$}5B as vulnerable. Manual
		  inspection of a sample of flagged contracts shows that
		  81{\%} of the sampled warnings do indeed lead to
		  vulnerabilities, which we report on in our experiment.},

                   (e.g., Ethereum) blockchains, whose popularity stem from
                   the possibility to perform financial transactions, such as
                   payments and auctions, in a distributed environment without
                   need for any trusted third party. Given their financial
                   nature, bugs or vulnerabilities in these programs may lead
                   to catastrophic consequences, as witnessed by recent
                   attacks. Unfortunately, programming smart contracts is a
                   delicate task that requires strong expertise: Ethereum
                   smart contracts are written in Solidity, a dedicated
                   language resembling JavaScript, and shipped over the
                   blockchain in the EVM bytecode format. In order to
                   rigorously verify the security of smart contracts, it is of
                   paramount importance to formalize their semantics as well
                   as the security properties of interest, in particular at
                   the level of the bytecode being executed. In this paper, we
                   present the first complete small-step semantics of EVM

                   formally define for the first time a number of central

                   integrity, atomicity, and independence from miner
                   controlled parameters. This formalization relies on a
                   combination of hyper- and safety properties. Along this

                   the blockchain technology market puts its main
                   cryptocurrencies in the spotlight. Among them, Ethereum
                   stands out due to its virtual machine (EVM) supporting
                   smart contracts, i.e., distributed programs that control
                   the flow of the digital currency Ether. Being written in a
                   Turing complete language, Ethereum smart contracts allow
                   for expressing a broad spectrum of financial applications.
                   The price for this expressiveness, however, is a
                   significant semantic complexity, which increases the risk
                   of programming errors. Recent attacks exploiting bugs in

  abstract  = {We coin the term Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLFs) to refer to protocols which establish distributed ledger-based markets for loanable funds. PLFs are emerging as one of the main applications within Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and use smart contract code to facilitate the intermediation of loanable funds. In doing so, these protocols allow agents to borrow and save programmatically. Within these protocols, interest rate mechanisms seek to equilibrate the supply and demand for funds. In this paper, we review the methodologies used to set interest rates on three prominent DeFi PLFs, namely Compound, Aave and dYdX. We provide an empirical examination of how these interest rate rules have behaved since their inception in response to differing degrees of liquidity. We then investigate the market efficiency and inter-connectedness between multiple protocols, examining first whether Uncovered Interest Parity holds within a particular protocol and second whether the interest rates for a particular token market show dependence across protocols, developing a Vector Error Correction Model for the dynamics.},

                   system. Agent intentions are not necessarily known and
                   autonomous agents have to be able to make decisions under
                   risk. The ramifications of these general conditions for
                   scalability are analysed for Ethereum and then generalised

               consumption leads to faster growth in offspring during
               suckling, and increased adiposity at 20 days of age.
               Decreased expression of the orexigenic neuropeptide Y (NPY)
               and increased anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA
               expression were observed in the fed state. However, hunger
               is the major drive to eat and hypothalamic appetite
               regulators change in response to meals. Therefore, it is
               important to compare both satiated and fasting states.
               Female Sprague-Dawley rats (8 weeks old) were fed a
               cafeteria-style HFD (15.33 kJ/g) or chow for 5 weeks before
               mating, with the same diet continuing throughout gestation
               and lactation. At postnatal day 20, male pups were killed
               either after overnight fasting or in the fed state. Pups
               from obese dams were hyperphagic during both pre- and
               postweaning periods. Pups from obese dams had higher
               hypothalamic mRNA expression of POMC and NPY Y1 receptor,
               but lower hypothalamic melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) and
               its downstream target single-minded gene 1 (Sim1), in the
               fed state. Overnight fasting reduced circulating glucose,
               insulin, and leptin and increased hypothalamic NPY Y1
               receptor mRNA in pups from both lean and obese dams.
               Hypothalamic NPY and agouti-related protein (AgRP) were
               only increased by fasting in pups from obese dams;
               reductions in MC4R and Sim1 were only seen in pups from
               lean dams. At weaning, the suppressed orexigenic signals in
               offspring from obese dams were normalized after overnight
               fasting, although anorexigenic signaling appeared impaired
               in these animals. This may contribute to their hyperphagia

  abstract = {Motivation. Public ledger is a decentralized book keeping
              technology and is believed to have the potential to
              revolutionize many areas. Besides handling crypto-currency,
              public ledger can be used to tokenize arbitrary assets, and
              then support trading of these asset tokens in a
              decentralized manner. With public ledger based token
              trading system, users do not necessarily convert their
              assets to currencies, but can exchange assets directly. It
              also avoids unnecessary transportation as the asset only
              needs to be physically transferred to its last owner.
              Furthermore, utilization of the public ledger does not
              require that users have to trust each other in order to
              trade tokens safely. However, using decentralized public
              ledger for trading asset tokens raises serious privacy
              concerns. Because token ownership information is stored on
              the public ledger and disclosed to the public, anyone can
              uncover users trading activities and history. For a token
              based asset trading platform, all tokens are unique and
              transactions are usually two-ways or multi-ways. In
              response to these challenges, we propose ZeroTrade, a
              privacy respecting heterogeneous assets trading system that
              leverages various cryptography tools to conceal the
              exchange trace of asset tokens and takes advantage of
              public ledger for guaranteeing fairness of asset token
              exchange. Solution. ZeroTrade involves trusted hubs that
              are responsible for converting assets to tokens and back,
              where trusted means that hubs will generate/accept valid
              tokens, and uses the public ledger to record all token
              exchange information. When two or more users want to
              exchange tokens with each other, each user picks an agent
              for the exchange. Asset tokens are first poured into a pool
              and users leverage agents to obliviously retrieve tokens
              from the pool in order to finish the exchange. The
              oblivious retrieving process cut off the connection between
              the original user and the agent. Therefore, one cannot
              determine the relationship between the original users who
              want to exchange tokens by observing information recorded
              on the public ledger. To implement the design, ZeroTrade
              leverages different cryptography tools including
              zero-knowledge proof and various encryption techniques.
              Considering various demands in token trade, ZeroTrade also
              supports operations like partial token trade and
              revocation. A preliminary evaluation of the performance
              shows that ZeroTrade only adds limited burden on top of the
              public ledger. More detailed information can be found in
              the full version of the paper. Conclusion. ZeroTrade
              provides a privacy friendly platform for asset trading
              based on public ledger. For the next step, we plan to
              implement a fully functional prototype and considering more
              complex token trading scenarios. {\textcopyright}

  abstract     = {Cryptocurrencies record transactions in a decentralized
                  data structure called a blockchain. Two of the most popular
                  cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, support the
                  fea-ture to encode rules or scripts for processing
                  transactions. This feature has evolved to give practical
                  shape to the ideas of smart contracts, or full-fledged
                  programs that are run on blockchains. Recently, Ethereum's
                  smart contract system has seen steady adoption, supporting
                  tens of thousands of contracts, holding millions dollars
                  worth of virtual coins. In this paper, we investigate the
                  security of running smart contracts based on Ethereum in an
                  open distributed network like those of cryptocurrencies. We
                  introduce several new se-curity problems in which an
                  adversary can manipulate smart contract execution to gain
                  profit. These bugs suggest subtle gaps in the understanding
                  of the distributed semantics of the underlying platform. As
                  a refinement, we propose ways to enhance the operational
                  semantics of Ethereum to make con-tracts less vulnerable.
                  For developers writing contracts for the existing Ethereum
                  system, we build a symbolic execution tool called Oyente to
                  find potential security bugs. Among 19, 366 existing
                  Ethereum contracts, Oyente flags 8, 833 of them as
                  vulnerable, including the TheDAO bug which led to a 60
                  million US dollar loss in June 2016. We also discuss the
                  severity of other attacks for several case studies which
                  have source code available and confirm the attacks (which
                  target only our accounts) in the main Ethereum network.},

		  blockchains like Ethereum---carry billions of dollars worth
		  of coins and cannot be updated once deployed. We present a
		  new systematic characterization of a class of trace
		  vulnerabilities, which result from analyzing multiple
		  invocations of a contract over its lifetime. We focus
		  attention on three example properties of such trace
		  vulnerabilities: finding contracts that either lock funds
		  indefinitely, leak them carelessly to arbitrary users, or
		  can be killed by anyone. We implemented MAIAN, the first
		  tool for precisely specifying and reasoning about trace
		  properties, which employs inter-procedural symbolic
		  analysis and concrete validator for exhibiting real
		  exploits. Our analysis of nearly one million contracts
		  flags 34,200 (2,365 distinct) contracts vulnerable, in 10
		  seconds per contract. On a subset of3,759 contracts which
		  we sampled for concrete validation and manual analysis, we
		  reproduce real exploits at a true positive rate of 89{\%},
		  yielding exploits for3,686 contracts. Our tool finds
		  exploits for the infamous Parity bug that indirectly locked
		  200 million dollars worth in Ether, which previous analyses
		  failed to capture.},

                   infrastructure have threatened public and private sectors.
                   Meanwhile, ubiquitous tracking and wearable computing have
                   infringed upon privacy. Advocates and engineers have
                   recently proposed using defensive deception as a means to
                   leverage the information asymmetry typically enjoyed by
                   attackers as a tool for defenders. The term deception,
                   however, has been employed broadly and with a variety of
                   meanings. In this paper, we survey 24 articles from
                   2007-2017 that use game theory to model defensive deception
                   for cybersecurity and privacy. Then we propose a taxonomy
                   that defines six types of deception: perturbation, moving
                   target defense, obfuscation, mixing, honey-x, and attacker
                   engagement. These types are delineated by their incentive
                   structures, agents, actions, and duration: precisely
                   concepts captured by game theory. Our aims are to
                   rigorously define types of defensive deception, to capture
                   a snapshot of the state of the literature, to provide a

  abstract  = {The trustless nature of permissionless blockchains renders overcollateralization a key safety component relied upon by decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. Nonetheless, factors such as price volatility may undermine this mechanism. In order to protect protocols from suffering losses, undercollateralized positions can be liquidated. In this paper, we present the first in-depth empirical analysis of liquidations on protocols for loanable funds (PLFs). We examine Compound, one of the most widely used PLFs, for a period starting from its conception to September 2020. We analyze participants' behavior and risk-appetite in particular, to elucidate recent developments in the dynamics of the protocol. Furthermore, we assess how this has changed with a modification in Compound's incentive structure and show that variations of only 3{\%} in an asset's dollar price can result in over 10 m USD becoming liquidable. To further understand the implications of this, we investigate the efficiency of liquidators. We find that liquidators' efficiency has improved significantly over time, with currently over 70{\%} of liquidable positions being immediately liquidated. Lastly, we provide a discussion on how a false sense of security fostered by a misconception of the stability of non-custodial stablecoins, increases the overall liquidation risk faced by Compound participants.},

  abstract  = {{\textcopyright} 2015 ACM. Efficient concurrent programs
               and data structures rarely employ coarse-grained
               synchronization mechanisms (i.e., locks); instead, they
               implement custom synchronization patterns via fine-grained
               primitives, such as compare-and-swap. Due to sophisticated
               interference scenarios between threads, reasoning about
               such programs is challenging and error-prone, and can
               benefit from mechanization. In this paper, we present the
               first completely formalized framework for mechanized
               verification of full functional correctness of fine-grained
               concurrent programs. Our tool is based on the recently
               proposed program logic FCSL. It is implemented as an
               embedded domain-specific language in the dependently-typed
               language of the Coq proof assistant, and is powerful enough
               to reason about programming features such as higher-order
               functions and local thread spawning. By incorporating a
               uniform concurrency model, based on state-transition
               systems and partial commutative monoids, FCSL makes it
               possible to build proofs about concurrent libraries in a
               thread-local, compositional way, thus facilitating
               scalability and reuse: libraries are verified just once,
               and their specifi-cations are used ubiquitously in
               client-side reasoning. We illustrate the proof layout in
               FCSL by example, and report on our experience of using FCSL
               to verify a number of concurrent programs.},

  abstract  = {Distributed systems play a crucial role in modern
               infrastructure, but are notoriously difficult to implement
               correctly. This difficulty arises from two main challenges:
               (a) correctly implementing core system components (e.g.,
               two-phase commit), so all their internal invariants hold,
               and (b) correctly composing standalone system components
               into functioning trustworthy applications (e.g., persistent
               storage built on top of a two-phase commit instance).
               Recent work has developed several approaches for addressing
               (a) by means of mechanically verifying implementations of
               core distributed components, but no methodology exists to
               address (b) by composing such verified components into
               larger verified applications. As a result, expensive
               verification efforts for key system components are not
               easily reusable, which hinders further verification
               efforts. In this paper, we present Disel, the first
               framework for implementation and compositional verification
               of distributed systems and their clients, all within the
               mechanized, foundational context of the Coq proof
               assistant. In Disel, users implement distributed systems
               using a domain specific language shallowly embedded in Coq
               and providing both high-level programming constructs as
               well as low-level communication primitives. Components of
               composite systems are specified in Disel as protocols,
               which capture system-specific logic and disentangle system
               definitions from implementation details. By virtue of
               Disel's dependent type system, well-typed implementations
               always satisfy their protocols' invariants and never go
               wrong, allowing users to verify system implementations
               interactively using Disel's Hoare-style program logic,
               which extends state-of-the-art techniques for concurrency
               verification to the distributed setting. By virtue of the
               substitution principle and frame rule provided by Disel's
               logic, system components can be composed leading to
               modular, reusable verified distributed systems. We describe
               Disel, illustrate its use with a series of examples,
               outline its logic and metatheory, and report on our
               experience using it as a framework for implementing,
               specifying, and verifying distributed systems. 1
               INTRODUCTION Real-world software systems, including
               distributed systems, are rarely built as standalone,
               monolithic pieces of code. Rather, they are composed of
               multiple independent modules, which are connected either by
               the linker or through communication channels. Such a
               compositional approach enables clean separation of concerns
               and a modular development process: in order to use one
               component within a larger system, one only needs to know
               what it does without requiring details on how it works.
               Unfortunately, the benefits of modular software development
               are not yet fully realized in the context of verified
               distributed systems. Recent work has produced several
               impressive formal proofs of correctness for implementations
               of core distributed system components, ranging from
               consensus protocols to causally consistent key-value stores
               (Hawblitzel et al. 2015; Lesani et al. 2016; Newcombe et
               al. 2015; Wilcox et al. 2015). These artifacts, while
               formally verified are not immediately reusable in the
               context of larger verified applications. For example, to
               compose a linearizable database with a causally consistent
               cache (Ahamad et al. 1995), one would need a framework
               general enough to express both specifications and reason
               about their interaction. Furthermore, existing verified
               systems entangle implementation details with abstract
               protocol definitions, preventing independent evolution and
               requiring extensive refactoring when changes are made (Woos
               et al. 2016). Finally, like all software, real-world
               distributed systems exist in an open world, and should be
               usable in multiple contexts by various clients, each of
               which may make different assumptions.},

@article{tonelli2018,
  abstract      = {Smart contracts (SC) are software codes which reside and
                   run over a blockchain. The code can be written in different
                   languages with the common purpose of implementing various
                   kinds of transactions onto the hosting blockchain, They are
                   ruled by the blockchain infrastructure and work in order to
                   satisfy conditions typical of traditional contracts. The
                   software code must satisfy constrains strongly context
                   dependent which are quite different from traditional
                   software code. In particular, since the bytecode is
                   uploaded in the hosting blockchain, size, computational
                   resources, interaction between different parts of software
                   are all limited and even if the specific software languages
                   implement more or less the same constructs of traditional
                   languages there is not the same freedom as in normal
                   software development. SC software is expected to reflect
                   these constrains on SC software metrics which should
                   display metric values characteristic of the domain and
                   different from more traditional software metrics. We tested
                   this hypothesis on the code of more than twelve thousands
                   SC written in Solidity and uploaded on the Ethereum
                   blockchain. We downloaded the SC from a public repository
                   and computed the statistics of a set of software metrics
                   related to SC and compared them to the metrics extracted
                   from more traditional software projects. Our results show
                   that generally Smart Contracts metrics have ranges more
                   restricted than the corresponding metrics in traditional
                   software systems. Some of the stylized facts, like power
                   law in the tail of the distribution of some metrics, are
                   only approximate but the lines of code follow a log normal
                   distribution which reminds of the same behavior already
                   found in traditional software systems.},

  abstract	= {Smart contracts (SC) are software codes which reside and
		  run over a blockchain. The code can be written in different
		  languages with the common purpose of implementing various
		  kinds of transactions onto the hosting blockchain, They are
		  ruled by the blockchain infrastructure and work in order to
		  satisfy conditions typical of traditional contracts. The
		  software code must satisfy constrains strongly context
		  dependent which are quite different from traditional
		  software code. In particular, since the bytecode is
		  uploaded in the hosting blockchain, size, computational
		  resources, interaction between different parts of software
		  are all limited and even if the specific software languages
		  implement more or less the same constructs of traditional
		  languages there is not the same freedom as in normal
		  software development. SC software is expected to reflect
		  these constrains on SC software metrics which should
		  display metric values characteristic of the domain and
		  different from more traditional software metrics. We tested
		  this hypothesis on the code of more than twelve thousands
		  SC written in Solidity and uploaded on the Ethereum
		  blockchain. We downloaded the SC from a public repository
		  and computed the statistics of a set of software metrics
		  related to SC and compared them to the metrics extracted
		  from more traditional software projects. Our results show
		  that generally Smart Contracts metrics have ranges more
		  restricted than the corresponding metrics in traditional
		  software systems. Some of the stylized facts, like power
		  law in the tail of the distribution of some metrics, are
		  only approximate but the lines of code follow a log normal
		  distribution which reminds of the same behavior already
		  found in traditional software systems.},

  abstract        = {Permissionless blockchains allow the execution of
                     arbitrary programs (called smart contracts), enabling
                     mutually untrusted entities to interact without relying on
                     trusted third parties. Despite their potential, repeated
                     security concerns have shaken the trust in handling
                     billions of USD by smart contracts. To address this
                     problem, we present Securify, a security analyzer for
                     Ethereum smart contracts that is scalable, fully automated,
                     and able to prove contract behaviors as safe/unsafe with
                     respect to a given property. Securify's analysis consists
                     of two steps. First, it symbolically analyzes the
                     contract's dependency graph to extract precise semantic
                     information from the code. Then, it checks compliance and
                     violation patterns that capture sufficient conditions for
                     proving if a property holds or not. To enable
                     extensibility, all patterns are specified in a designated
                     domain-specific language. Securify is publicly released,
                     has {\~{}}22K users, and is regularly used to conduct
                     security audits. We present an extensive evaluation of
                     Securify over real-world Ethereum smart contracts and
                     demonstrate that it can effectively prove the correctness
                     of smart contracts and discover critical violations.},

              thorough understanding of blockchain bug characteristics is
              required to design effective tools for preventing,
              detecting and mitigating bugs. We perform an empirical
              study on bug charac-teristics in eight representative open
              source blockchain systems. First, we manually examine 1,108
              bug reports to understand the nature of the reported bugs.
              Second, we leverage card sorting to label the bug reports,
              and obtain ten bug categories in blockchain systems. We
              further investigate the frequency distribution of bug
              categories across projects and programming languages.
              Finally, we study the relationship between bug categories
              and bug fixing time. The findings include: (1) semantic
              bugs are the dominant runtime bug category; (2) frequency
              distributions of bug types show similar trends across
              different projects and programming languages; (3) security
              bugs take the longest median time to be fixed; (4)
              35.71{\%} performance bugs are fixed in more than one year;
              performance bugs take the longest average time to be
              fixed.},

              bug distinctly. Semantic would be the cause of the bug and

		  thorough understanding of blockchain bug characteristics is
		  required to design effective tools for preventing,
		  detecting and mitigating bugs. We perform an empirical
		  study on bug charac-teristics in eight representative open
		  source blockchain systems. First, we manually examine 1,108
		  bug reports to understand the nature of the reported bugs.
		  Second, we leverage card sorting to label the bug reports,
		  and obtain ten bug categories in blockchain systems. We
		  further investigate the frequency distribution of bug
		  categories across projects and programming languages.
		  Finally, we study the relationship between bug categories
		  and bug fixing time. The findings include: (1) semantic
		  bugs are the dominant runtime bug category; (2) frequency
		  distributions of bug types show similar trends across
		  different projects and programming languages; (3) security
		  bugs take the longest median time to be fixed; (4)
		  35.71{\%} performance bugs are fixed in more than one year;
		  performance bugs take the longest average time to be
		  fixed.},
  annote	= { Bug types are not mutually exclusive but bugs are only
		  assigned a single type. A bug could belong to both semantic
		  and security type. A better classification could be to
		  consider the cause of the bug and the consequence of the
		  bug distinctly. Semantic would be the cause of the bug and
		  security its impact.
		  
		  Finding the relation between cause of the bugs and their
		  impact could also be interesting. },

  abstract  = {In Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies, fair reward distribution within mining pools has become a popular area of research. Aside from a theoretical grounding, mining pool reward scheme research has commonly involved discrete event simulations of deterministic miner behaviour under different reward schemes. However, until now researchers have been left with the tedious task of developing their own mining pool simulation software, a rather time-consuming and potentially extensive undertaking, as miner behaviour becomes more complex. We present PoolSim, an open-source and very extensible discrete event simulation framework for modelling different behaviours of miners under any reward distribution scheme. By utilising this framework for different hypothetical mining scenarios, we showcase that mining pool reward scheme analysis indeed remains an exciting area for future research. Further, we believe that PoolSim will vastly increase productivity of researchers focusing on mining pools.},

@article{zhou2018,
  abstract = {Interacting with Ethereum smart contracts can have
              potentially devastating financial consequences. In light of
              this, several regulatory bodies have called for a need to
              audit smart contracts for security and correctness
              guarantees. Unfortunately, auditing smart contracts that do
              not have readily available source code can be challenging ,
              and there are currently few tools available that aid in
              this process. Such contracts remain opaque to auditors. To
              address this, we present Erays, a reverse engineering tool
              for smart contracts. Erays takes in smart contract from the
              Ethereum blockchain, and produces high-level pseudocode
              suitable for manual analysis. We show how Erays can be used
              to provide insight into several contract properties, such
              as code complexity and code reuse in the ecosystem. We then
              leverage Erays to link contracts with no previously
              available source code to public source code, thus reducing
              the overall opacity in the ecosystem. Finally, we
              demonstrate how Erays can be used for reverse-engineering
              in four case studies: high-value multi-signature wallets,
              arbitrage bots, exchange accounts, and finally, a popular
              smart-contract game, Cryptokitties. We conclude with a
              discussion regarding the value of reverse engineering in
              the smart contract ecosystem, and how Erays can be
              leveraged to address the challenges that lie ahead.},
