\begin{abstract}

Blockchain systems have gain traction in the previous years and the number of applications lever-aging them is growing fast. While a major selling point of blockchain systems lies in the inherent security they provide, they have a very large attack surface that is yet to be fully explored. In our thesis, we explore, and try to improve, the security of blockchains execution and applicationlayers. In particular, we present attacks, defenses and analyses on topics spanning from the virtualmachine execution environment to the Decentralized Finance protocols implemented on top ofit, with a general emphasis on Ethereum.
