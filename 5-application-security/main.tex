\chapter{Application Security}
\label{ch:application-security}

In this chapter, we go one level further up in the blockchain stack and focus on the security of applications built on top of the blockchain.
To do so, we first introduce the concepts of technical and economic security.
We then present an analysis of on-chain technical exploits, focusing on the most common classes of technical vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy.
Finally, we explore economic security further by focusing on over-collateralization in lending protocols.
