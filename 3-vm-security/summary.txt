We present a new type of DoS attack we call Resource Exhaustion Attack, which uses imperfections of the EVM gas pricing to generate low-throughput contracts. Using this method, we show that we are able to generate contracts with a throughput on average 50 times slower than typical contracts. We show that all major Ethereum clients are currently vulnerable. Such malicious contracts can be used to prevent nodes with lower hardware capacity from participating in the network, thereby artificially reducing the level of decentralization the network can deliver.
